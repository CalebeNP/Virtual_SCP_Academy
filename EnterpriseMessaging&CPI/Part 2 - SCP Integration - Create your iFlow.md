Part 2: Create your iFlow
=========================

In this exercise, you are going to use **SAP Cloud Platform Integration service**
and create your first integration flow (iFlow). <br/><br/>
**SAP Cloud Platform Integration service** helps you to connect cloud and on-premise 
applications with other SAP and non-SAP cloud and on-premise applications. This 
service has the capabilities to process messages in real-time scenarios spanning 
different companies, organizations, or departments within one organization.<br/>
For further information about this service, refer to the following documentation: 
https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CLOUD_INTEGRATION/Cloud/en-US?task=discover_task.
