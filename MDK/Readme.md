# SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services
As part of SAP's mobile strategy, we have 3 distinct mobile offerings that are contained within mobile Services:
- Mobile Cards
- Mobile Development Kit
- iOS SDK / Android SDK

## Mobile Cards
As part the mobile cards strategy, SAP provides a client called SAP Mobile Cards and you can check out the developer tutorials here:

https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mobile-cards-setup.html

Here you can see the Mobile cards client, it's essentially for the development and delivery of micro applications. Applications that are limited in complexity but well suited to 1 small form, think Approvals as the perfect use case. Cards can be pushed using Mobile Services and users can subscribe to the cards that are interesting to them.

## Mobile Development Kit

The 3rd pillar and the one we will use for this exercise is the SAP Mobile Development Kit. The Mobile Development Kit is a framework for mobile development that is provided by SAP for the creation of Mobile Applications that can be configured in a Web Browser and then run as native application on both Android and Apple devices.
