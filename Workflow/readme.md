At the end of this session you will have a live safety incident workflow deployed on SAP Cloud Platform but it will not be using the service you created in week one. You will be using a test service created by SAP.

In a few weeks, we will show you how to create incidents with **your** CAP service. You can then modify this workflow to see Safety Incidents in action - Live.

## The Safety Incident Process 

When a safety incident is logged by an employee, A workflow will be triggered for the safety officer to be notified so that he/she may take the appropriate action. 

As you move through the different sections of this technical academy, you will start to develop an integrated safety incident management application.

In this section you will;
- Understand how to model, test and deploy workflows on SAP Cloud Platform by developing a workflow for Safety Incident Management.

We will be using the SAP WebIDE to model, build and deploy the workflows.
